Collablocks was a 2nd place winner at a 24 hour Facebook hackathon. It is a social experimental game that aims at providing a platform to engage large audiences in a collaborative gaming experience. The video game is composed of a 3D puzzle that participants from the audience can join in together and solve collaboratively. The participants connect by visiting the browser application and find themselves in control of a layer of blocks in a 3D grid of blocks where each participant each such layer. The goal of the game is to fill a randomly generated wireframe within this cube by working together.
