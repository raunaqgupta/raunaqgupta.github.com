overview: A social experimental game played on connected devices amongst a group of co-located people via a large shared screen. Runner-up at CMU Facebook Hackathon 2012.

contributions: I contributed to the design of the UI and WebGL based visualization for the large shared display. I also co-wrote code for the Node.JS and socketstream based back-end.

<h4>Concept</h4>

It is a social experimental game that aims at providing a platform to engage large audiences in a collaborative gaming experience. The video game is composed of a 3D puzzle that participants from the audience can join in together and solve collaboratively. The participants connect by visiting the browser application and find themselves in control of a layer of blocks in a 3D grid of blocks where each participant each such layer. The goal of the game is to fill a randomly generated wireframe within this cube by working together.

<h4>Technology</h4>

The app built atop Node.JS and socketstream and the visualizations were created with WebGL and Javascript.
