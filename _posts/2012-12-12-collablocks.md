Collablocks is a social experimental game which tries to put a co-located group of people together to solve a 3D based puzzle. The game itself is displayed on a public screen and individual gamers can join via their mobile devices.

<h4>Concept</h4>

It is a social experimental game that aims at providing a platform to engage large audiences in a collaborative gaming experience. The video game is composed of a 3D puzzle that participants from the audience can join in together and solve collaboratively. The participants connect by visiting the browser application and find themselves in control of a layer of blocks in a 3D grid of blocks where each participant each such layer. The goal of the game is to fill a randomly generated wireframe within this cube by working together.

<h4>Role</h4>

We built and tested Collablocks during Facebook CMU hackathon in 2012 and were runner-ups at the event. I was one of the programmers in the team of four using node.js, socketstream and webGL to create the experience.

<h4>Team</h4>

Jonas Gebhardt + Jonathan Chan + Noah Bernstein

<h4>Technology</h4>

The app built atop Node.JS and socketstream and the visualizations were created with WebGL and Javascript.
