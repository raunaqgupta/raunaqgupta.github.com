4Today is a mobile application that gives users sets of small, charitable and random tasks each day to improve personal well-being and would also aid the community.

<h4>Motivation</h4>

We reviewed research on the psychology of subjective well-being to design solutions that encourage and improve human happiness. After collating our literature review we came up with various contributors to subjective well-being and possible ideas that can utilize these findings.

* Snap Roulette

*Emotions are contagious* | *Smiling makes us happier*

From research we found out that emotions can be evoked by stimulus of watching expressive faces and that encouraging smiling over a period of time can lead to behavioral change. With these insights we ideated to come up with Snap Roulette; a set of public installation located in different places around the world encouraging people to take goofy photos of themselves. Each installatin would then display an ever-changing set of random photos taken at installations everywhere.

Snap roulette would aim to project silly and happy expressions of people around the world into public environments. And by encouraging people to take silly photos, it provides additional motivation for people to smile in their day.

* Goals with friends

*Goal striving has positive effects*

The literature review provided us with results that having a goal based outlook can lead to an increase in subjective well-being. With this we tried to incorporate social connections to encourage social motivation. Goals with friends is a platform where users make their goals visible to friends and family. The user's goals are broken down into sub-goals to encourage completion.

Friends can motivate each other by joining existing goals and offering advice and encouragement.

* 4today

*Enjoyment is enhanced by shared happiness* | *Giving makes people happier*

From research we found out that providing avenues to share happiness can lead to increase in how it is perceived. Also charity provides a way to improve one's positive outlook towards oneselves and can improve well-being.

4today aimed to be a platform where users would be given a set of small,charitable and randomized tasks each day. Accomplishing tasks would reward player with points and achievements. Certain tasks would be communal and collaborative in nature to bring 'players' to interact and work together for the local community.

With 4today our aim was to disrupt the daily routine to make a positive impact on their social and environmental surroundings.


<h4>Gathering data</h4>

We conducted an online survey involving 32 participants which asked questions about goals, motivation and community service. Through this survey we realized that a large part of the respondents were unaware of community service activities in their local areas and were not involved with any charitable groups or organizations. What was surprising was that about 80% of respondents had donated money to some charitable cause or the other and that they stated lack of time as the primary reason to not be able to participate.

We felt that 4today could serve as a viable solution to better inform the local community of ways that they can contribute. From here on, we decided to flesh out the concept through personas and storyboarding.

<h4>Storyboarding</h4>

We created storyboards to test scenarios in which a suitable application might seem useful.

<h4>Prototypes</h4>

We went through two rounds of initial prototyping to iterate over the application flow and features.

Hi-fidelity prototypes were then created in Photoshop and tested with the local student population.
