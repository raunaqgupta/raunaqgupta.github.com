<h4>Literature Review and Motivation</h4>

The way to tackle the problem was to see how people think about memory and how current rendition of the browser history fails. For this we did a literature review of academic research on the subjects of episodic memory, activity and context awareness and other published and patented methods of web browsing sessions and workspace managers.

<h4>Prototypes</h4>

Two levels of prototype fidelity were used to define the various screens and application flow.
