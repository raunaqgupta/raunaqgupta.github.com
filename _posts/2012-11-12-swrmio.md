<h4>Creating a community</h4>

We wanted to create a community which thrives on self-feedback; focusing on something more than just a simple 'thumbs up' or a 'thumbs down'. The concept for the user experience was built atop providing users an easy access to upload their design work and to instantly get feedback from the 'hivemind'. Our focus was based on two kinds of users; potential beginners in the design field looking for good critique instantly and the 'experts' providing it to gain points to themselves earn the ability to post content.

We focus on three kind of interactions; the uploading and receiving of digital content, the giving of feedback and finally, rating the feedback provided by other users on the system. This way we hope to create a community which curates it's own content and makes sure that the 'beginner' receives the best feedback for her work.
