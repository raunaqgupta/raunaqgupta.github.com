<h3>Prompt</h3>

A group of us decided to band together to attend a class on how to create a startup idea at Carnegie Mellon University. We were two designers and two developers coming from different industries and backgrounds, just entering grad school to learn about design and felt that services like dribbble were more back-patting then encouraging honest feedback to help new designers become good. With swrm.io we aimed to create a platform which would incentivize community to take pride in showing works-in-progress and drafts and to give and receive feedback responsibly.

<h3>Process</h3>

Our process involved a lot of competitive analysis of existing services that were functioning in this space. Two notable ones included dribbble and behance at the time and we felt that both of them catered to a very niche and unique space. We felt Swrm.io (back then called swarm.com) would be a great addition for new designers.

<h4>Creating a community</h4>

We wanted to create a community which thrives on self-feedback; focusing on something more than just a simple 'thumbs up' or a 'thumbs down'. The concept for the user experience was built atop providing users an easy access to upload their design work and to instantly get feedback from the 'hivemind'. Our focus was based on two kinds of users; potential beginners in the design field looking for good critique instantly and the 'experts' providing it to gain points to themselves earn the ability to post content.

We focus on three kind of interactions; the uploading and receiving of digital content, the giving of feedback and finally, rating the feedback provided by other users on the system. This way we hope to create a community which curates it's own content and makes sure that the 'beginner' receives the best feedback for her work.

<h4>Flow, Wireframing and Web Development</h4>

Our design process included coming up with features for our minimum viable product. We translated our features into an application flow diagram to get a sense of how each part of the product would fit well within the entire system. We then moved to wireframing the user interface and the various screens.

The development work was done completely in Javascript using Node.JS as the back-end server and utilizing SocketStream (WebSocket/socket.io wrapper) for pub/sub communication. We used Angular.JS as the front-end framework and utilized MongoDB as the database of choice. We also employed Redis as a cache database.

<h3>Outcome</h3>

[Swrm.io](http://swrm.io) is a web service to help designers get valuable crowdsourced feedback online. It helps graphic designers publish their drafts and artifacts to quickly get critical feedback which can potentially help them improve their designs and serve humanity better.
