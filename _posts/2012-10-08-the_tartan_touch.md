As part of the UIST 2012 student competition, we got the opportunity to work on a yet unreleased Synaptics device codenamed 'Jedeye'. It is a touch-pad with the ability to measure finger pressure for upto 64 pressure points. The goal of the competition was to utilize this new dimension in touch based surfaces to demonstrate potential applications.

Our demo titled 'The Tartan Touch' (named after CMU's mascot) was a web application that tried to solve the problem of occlusion in digital drawing applications such as Photoshop which utilize layer based construction.

Jonas Gebhardt was kind enough to be in the video demonstration:
