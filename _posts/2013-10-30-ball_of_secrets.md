Ball of Secrets is a hardware/toy concept which stemmed from a discussion of creating tangible memories for TEI 2013. The Ball of Secrets was designed to experiment a unique interaction, providing play like attributes to storing secrets. It was submitted as an entry for the creative showcase section at ACE 2013 (http://www.advancesincomputerentertainment.org/)

<h4>Concept</h4>

Ball of Secrets provides the holder of the ball with a set of 6 buttons. These 6 buttons can be pressed in various combination to activate the microphone to record audio samples or to listen to a previously stored audio sample.

<h4>Prototypes</h4>

The first prototype was geared towards getting the basic structure, electronics and interactions in place.

The second prototype saw us moving to a smaller form factor, a better appreciation of the electronics in use and moving around the components for better recording and feedback. For instance we we added a LED on the side closer to the user which would turn red when the recording capability was activated.

The second prototype was also when we started taking more photos of the process.

<h4>Paper</h4>

A short paper was written for the submission: <a href="/img/img_ball_of_secrets/MarginesGuptaChisik_BallOfSecrets.pdf">Ball Of Secrets</a>

<h4>Role</h4>

I alongwith with Ben Margines ideated, designed and developed the concept. I was then responsible to write the ACE 2013 conference paper with inputs from Yoram Chisik and Ben Margines.
