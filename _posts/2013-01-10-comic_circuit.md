abstract: Web service to foster crowdsourced comic creation. CHI 2013 design competition finalist.
---

Comic Circuit was a CHI 2013 student design competition finalist. It aims to construct an online community and user interface toolkit to crowdsource news articles into comic strips.

My role was two-fold: I was the user interface designer wherein I employed paper prototyping techinques together together with Balsamiq and Photoshop to create various low to mid-fidelity prototypes. I was responsible for using these prototypes to test the interface and the comic creation toolkit with users.

As part of our submission, I was also involved in translating the prototypes into a web-based hi-fidelity prototype. Our paper as part of the CHI2013 proceedings can be viewed at: <a href="/res/res_comic_circuit/comic_circuit_chi2013.pdf">Comic Circuit</a>
