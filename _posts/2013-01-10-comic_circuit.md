abstract: A web service to foster crowdsourced comic creation. CHI 2013 design competition
  finalist.
overview: Comic Circuit is an online community and a user interface toolkit to crowdsource
  news articles into comic strips.
contributions: I took the role of the UX designer and prototyper which saw me working
  on paper prototypes, creating mid-fidelity mockups in Balsamiq and Photoshop and
  contributing to the final prototype developed in HTML5/Javascript.
team: Ben Margines, Nancy Chen, Rebecca Jablonsky, Shailie Thakkar
duration: 6 months

<h3>Prompt</h3>

The CHI 2013 student design competition came at an ideal time to utilize the skills that we were learning in grad school. The theme that year was **Empowering the Crowd: Changing perspectives through collaboration**. I was taking a class on *Computer Supported Collaborative Work* and was excited to be part of a submission. In this age of hyper information and micro-news, using comics to dessiminate important stories became a worthwhile endeavor to pursue.

I have been a huge consumer of comics in the past and felt that we could tackle a great problem of declining interest in current affairs amongst the youth through a platform that would encourage not only consumption but also facilitate creation via tools and crowdsourced participation.

<h3>Process</h3>

As part of a team of 5 and a faculty mentor in Dr. Steven Dow who specializes in creative crowdsourcing, we went through a unique design process that involved conducting expert interviews, mTurk experiments, multi-fidelity design and user testing.

<h4>Crowd experiments, prototyping and usability testing</h4>

We conducted crowd experiments through Amazon Mechanical Turk to compare and analyze multiple design directions; whether it's better to let users create comics straight up after reading a news article or letting them create a textual narration before delving into creating graphics. Our results showed that in the later scenario, the comics created were more informative but without a structure they were more off-topic, creative and funny.

We decided to break up the process of creating the comic into two stages but with the ability to have more freedom in one's creation. We created paper prototypes to define our interface and the tools that would be necessary for people to create comics online. We then created some hi-fidelity assets to be used in our functional prototype in HTML5/Javascript. We tested this with users to further smooth out the flow.

<h3>Outcome</h3>

Comic Circuit envisioned a platform that can bring together people to create a self-sustainable community of creators and consumers through creative tools. Even more so, it thought about how a platform can leverage the crowd to reinvent how news and education can be made more engaging.

Comic Circuit was one of the top 10 finalists at CHI 2013 and we represented our design in front of a panel of judges in Paris. It was also published in Proceedings of CHI 2013; the paper can be seen here: http://goo.gl/rAv8rn
