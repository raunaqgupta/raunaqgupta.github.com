Comic Circuit was a CHI 2013 student design competition finalist. It aims to construct an online community and a user interface toolkit to crowdsource news articles into comic strips.

<h4>Prototyping</h4>

The ideation stage went through several iterations of paper based prototypes, refining the user interface through multiple iterations with low and mid-fidelity Balsamiq and Photoshop wireframes. The camera-ready prototype was then coded in HTML/Javascript for the final presentation at CHI 2013, Paris.
