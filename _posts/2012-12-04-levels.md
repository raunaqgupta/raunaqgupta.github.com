<h3>Prompt</h3>

Levels was designed as an assignment for a design studio class with the initial constraint of making a digital magazine about architecture. We did a competitive analysis of all the existing architecture based magazines both in print and digital formts and create a feature matrix to better understand the market. After taking into account all the information, we felt most strongly about doing a magazine about **virtual architecture**.

<h3>Process</h3>

<h4>Personas, Moodboarding, Visual Design and Prototyping</h4>

We built personas to empathize with the niche audience that would be interested in such a magazine. These personas targeted people involved in the 3D industry. Moodboarding allowed us to come up with a color scheme that conveyed the sense of being sharp, futuristic and digital; keywords that we were striving for the look and feel of the magazine. Our color palette developed from our moodboards and became the binding agent of our design concept.

Initial prototypes were made on paper and then transferred to Photoshop. We worked on splash screens, table of contents and an entire article worth of material to create a complete prototype.

<h3>Outcome</h3>

Levels is an iPad magazine design concept targeted towards 3d modelling and virtual architecture. The aesthetics focus on being edgy and futuristic with sharp lines and bright contrasting colors.
