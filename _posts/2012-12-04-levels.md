Levels is an iPad magazine designed for 3D modelers and video game enthusiasts.

<h4>Invisioning</h4>

Levels was designed as an assignment for a design studio class with the initial constraint of making a digital magazine about architecture. We did a competitive analysis of all the existing architecture based magazines both in print and digital formts and create a feature matrix to better understand the market. After taking into account all the information, we felt most strongly about doing a magazine about **virtual architecture**.

<h4>Defining an audience</h4>

From the competitive analysis and our own ideas of the niche segment that we were striving to capture, we built personas that would help us empathize with the magazine's target audience.

<h4>Visual and Information Design</h4>

We did an extended moodboard session where the colors tried to convey the sense of being sharp, digital and futuristic. Our color palette developed from our moodboards and became the binding agent of our design concept.

<h4>Prototyping</h4>

Initial prototypes were made on paper and then transferred to Photoshop. We worked on splash screens, table of contents and an entire article worth of material to create a complete prototype.
