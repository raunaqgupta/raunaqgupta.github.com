<h2>Health Record Redesign</h2>

As part of a VA sponsored health design challenge, our team was responsible for re-thinking visual components of the patient health records. The challenge sought to improve upon the current plaintext document by envisioning a patient-centric web and print alternative. We were showcased among the top 25 entries to the <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/challengepost/zip_files/production/5066/zip_files/ReimaginingPatientRecord.pdf?1354410791">challenge</a>.

<h4>Literature Review + Interviews</h4>

Our literature review informed us of how the current medical records were being used by the various stakeholders (patients, doctors, caregivers). We also conducted interviews to better understand the needs of patients and how they were not being met by the current record. Selecting patient quotes and affinitizing all our data then helped us further the information architecture of the record.

<h4>Visual Design</h4>

The record focused on highlighting key information regarding a patient's medical history and ailments through easy to understand charts, medical contacts and active prescriptions. Care was taken to make them readable among people with various disabilities and making it web reproducible.

<h4>Role</h4>

I was responsible for creating visual assets such as icons, graphs and defining individual page layouts. I worked with InDesign and Photoshop. One of the icons made its way to <a href="http://thenounproject.com/noun/medical-records/#icon-No8398">The Noun Project.</a>
