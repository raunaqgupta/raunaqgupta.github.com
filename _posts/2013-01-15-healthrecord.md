The Health Record was redesigned as part of a VA sponsored competition where I was part of the visual design team. Current VA-run hospitals use an archaic method of disseminating patient information and our team's role was to come up with an improved patient health record document.

My role as part of the team was to design and iterate over the various visual components. I was working mainly with Photoshop and InDesign, creating icons and document layouts. One of the icons made its way to <a href="http://thenounproject.com/noun/medical-records/#icon-No8398">The Noun Project.</a>

The design was focused on enabling patients to better understand the information pertaining to their medical history and ongoing medications. Our design incorporated a web-friendly approach wherein the design can easily be translated to a webpage for digital lookup.

Following are the various screens from the document:

<div id="myCarousel" class="carousel slide">

	<!-- Carousel items -->
	<div class="carousel-inner">
