<h3>Prompt</h3>

Our design task involved researching and building an application that can encourage and improve human happiness. Through a literature review of academic publications on the topic of subjective well-being, we collated our findings into themes that could help us brainstorm ideas.

<h3>Process</h3>

Our process started with distilling academic papers into themes that can help in brainstorming application ideas. Some of the phrases that informed our ideas included: *Emotions are contagious*, *Goal striving has positive effects* and *Enjoyment is enhanced by shared happiness*.

<h4>Brainstorming</h4>

We brainstormed keeping the phrases as the focal point. Some of our initial ideas included research that talked about how emotions can be evoked by stimulus of watching expressive faces and that encouraging smiling over a period of time can lead to behavioral change. *Snap roulette* would aim to project silly and happy expressions of people around the world into public environments.

Another idea came off from research that suggested that having a goal based outlook can lead to an increase in subjective well-being. *Goals with friends* is a platform where users make their goals visible to friends and family. The user's goals are broken down into sub-goals to encourage completion.

Lastly, we explored avenues of sharing happiness and how engaging in charity can improve one's outlook towards the self and create a more well-knit community. *4today* aimed to be a platform where users would be given a set of crowdsourced community tasks everyday.

<h4>Surveying, Storyboarding and Prototyping</h4>

We conducted an online survey involving 32 participants to gain an understanding of people's ideas about goals, motivations and community service. A major portion of respondents talked about donating money to well-known charitable causes but were unaware of their own local community activies and weren't directly involved with any non-profic outfits.

We felt that 4today could serve as a viable solution to better inform the local community of ways that they can contribute. From here on, we decided to flesh out the concept through storyboarding its use and wireframing concepts. We started off with ideating concepts and creating storyboards to depict appropriate use cases. We then moved to creating wireframing interface elements that would be crucial to depicting tasks and creating a personal profile to keep track of user activity. Lastly, various hi-fidelity screens were created in Photoshop.

<h3>Outcome</h3>

4today aims to be a platform where users would be given a set of small,charitable and randomized tasks each day crowdsourced by the local community. Accomplishing tasks would reward the player with points and achievements. Certain tasks would be communal and collaborative in nature to bring 'players' to interact and work together for the local community.

With 4today our aim was to disrupt the daily routine of people and to make a positive social and environmental impact.
