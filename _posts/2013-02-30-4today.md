<h4>Invisioning</h4>

We reviewed research on the psychology of subjective well-being to design solutions that encourage and improve human happiness. We found that giving makes people happier and that enjoyment is enhanced by shared happiness.

We also conducted an online survey involving 32 participants. Through this survey we realized that a large part of the respondents were unaware of community service activities in their local areas and were not involved with any charitable groups or organizations. What was surprising was that about 80% of respondents had donated money to some charitable cause or the other and that they stated lack of time as the primary reason to not be able to participate.

<h4>Storyboarding</h4>

We created storyboards to test scenarios in which a suitable application might seem useful.

<h4>Prototypes</h4>

Two levels of prototype fidelity were used to define the various screens and application flow.
